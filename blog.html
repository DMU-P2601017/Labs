         This <img> element is telling the browser to look in a folder called 'images', where it will find sun.jpg. 
         On GitHub though, you've not put it in a folder, so this url won't work. 
         You should either put sun.jpg in a folder called images, or update the src value

      Since I was born I had curly blond hair and green eyes with the hint of
      blue. My face is more like my dad's, same as my body and of course
      the hair. I am quite tall and slim, and no matter how hard
      I am trying to put on weight, I am not really succesful.
      I can't blame the genetics that much, because my eating habits
      are not brilliant.
      The only thing I inhirited from my mum are those eyes. I love them, but..
       sometimes I wish I could change them at least for a day or too, just to try
      to look like a little bit different person.
    </p>
    <h2 style="color: red">But how is it related to your topic then?</h2>
    <p> That's a good question. I have no idea, but I can tell you about
      my hair and how they are related to the topic.

           Your lists are a little wrong. There are two types of lists:
            - ordered i.e. numbered, lettered etc. These us an <ol> element
            - unordered i.e. bulleted. These us a <ul> element.

           In either case, the list starts with the opening tag, and ends with the closing tag:
            <ol>
            </ol>

           You then add list items <li> inside the list element.

          <ol>
            <li>List item one</li>
            <li>List item two</li>
            <li>List item three</li>
          </ol>

          You can have sub-lists by embedding lists inside eachother. 

          These sub-lists still need to be inside a list item though:

          <ul>
            <li>Coffee</li>
            <li>Tea
              <ul>
                <li>Black tea</li>
                <li>Green tea</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Milk</li>
          </ul>

          In light of this, your use of the list elements is a little off.

      <ol>
        <li>They are curly and messy.</li>
        <ul>
        <li>Kinda afro when they're too short.</li>
      </ul>
        <li>They were light blond with yellow tones.</li>
        <li>They just remind people of the sun.</li>
      </ol>
    <h2 style="color: red">Oh right, I get it know, but why you talk about them in past time?</h2>
    <p>Because I started dying them different colours, even though I sometimes
    miss how they looked like.</p>
    <h2 style="color: red">And is it like it? The whole blog just about your hair?!</h2>
    <p>Naaah, it would be too pointless and simple, I guess? People also call me
sunshine because I smile. I smile a lot, I don't have to have any particular reason
for it, I just like it. When I walk around the mirror and I see myself, I smile
or when I am trying to hide something (like for example some surprise). I
also have a habit to laugh at pretty stupid things that doesn't make any sence.
Or if my friend would fall in front of me, I would be red in few seconds.
I am not being mean.
I also think it's because I hate being depressed.</p>
<h2 style="color: red">I think that everybody hates feeling depressed.</h2>
<p>I know right. That is why I am sharing here few of my favourite channels and videos
  to watch on youtube.
