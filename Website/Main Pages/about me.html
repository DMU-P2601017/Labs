      <p>Since I was born I had curly blond hair and green eyes with the hint of
      blue. My face is more like my dad's, same as my body and of course
      the hair. I am quite tall and slim, and no matter how hard
      I am trying to put on weight, I am not really succesful.
      I can't blame the genetics that much, because my eating habits
      are not brilliant.
      The only thing I inhirited from my mum are those eyes. I love them, but..
       sometimes I wish I could change them at least for a day or too, just to try
      to look like a little bit different person.
    </p>
    <h2 style="color: red">But how is it related to your topic then?</h2>
    <p> That's a good question. I have no idea, but I can tell you about
      my hair and how they are related to the topic. </p>
      <h3 style="color: red">Because they're the reason,
      why people called me sunshine.</h3>
      <ul style="color: gold">
        <li>They are curly and messy.</li>
        <ul>
        <li>Kinda afro when they're too short.</li>
      </ul>
        <li>They were light blond with yellow tones.</li>
        <li>They just remind people of the sun.</li>
      </ul>
    <h2 style="color: red">Oh right, I get it know, but why you talk about them in past time?</h2>
    <p>Because I started dying them different colours, even though I sometimes
    miss how they looked like.</p>
    <h2 style="color: red">And is it like it? The whole blog just about your hair?!</h2>
    <p>Naaah, it would be too pointless and simple, I guess? People also call me
sunshine because I smile. I smile a lot, I don't have to have any particular reason
for it, I just like it. When I walk around the mirror and I see myself, I smile
or when I am trying to hide something (like for example some surprise). I
also have a habit to laugh at pretty stupid things that doesn't make any sence.
Or if my friend would fall in front of me, I would be red in few seconds.
I am not being mean.
I also think it's because I hate being depressed.</p>
<h2 style="color: red">I think that everybody hates feeling depressed.</h2>
<p>I know right. That is why I am sharing here few of my favourite channels
  to watch on youtube. </p>

<p>But that is not the only thing I like to watch on youtube. I am also
  big animal lover, I especially like cats and small dogs. Even though I
  can't have any pets at home, I like to visit places, where I can play with them
  or just watch them running around. I was growing up having
  few pets at home like hamster, bunnies and small puppy.
  Here is a video where I filmed one of the cutest kittens from the Kitty Cafe in Nottingham.</p>
