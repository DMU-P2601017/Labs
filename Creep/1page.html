      in div class element called container to seperate the menu from rest of the content on my page. Thanks

      <p>
      Meet Aaron, the videographer, who replied to an internet ad to film with a stranger, Josef,
      a movie. After Aaron arrives to his house, Josef agrees to make a documentary for his
      unborn child, as he suffers from cancer and doesn't know how long he will still live.
      Josef's requests are getting more bizzare and weird after certain amount of time and
      Aaron is questioning his true intentions.

        of the video, which I stopped at certain time and created poster from it. I
      had to set up proper width and height of this video to make it look good. I also had
      to put controls to it for viewers to be able to play and pause the video.-->

        and in every browser and alternative ogg format, if the mp4 won't work.-->

        <a href="video/creep trailer.mp4">here</a> or you can
          watch the original <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2y8kKsxeII">here</a>.
          <!--Fallback if the video is not working on my page. I thought it would be nice to also include the original video from
          youtube than just let the person download it from my page. First link is internal,
          so it referes to one of my folders and other one is external, which referes to link
          "outside" of my document.-->
